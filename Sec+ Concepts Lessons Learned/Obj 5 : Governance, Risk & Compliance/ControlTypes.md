<h1>Control types in the infosec world</h1>

<h2>Here are the following control types used in the information security field:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identity Federation - Identity Provider (IdPs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Identity Provider (IdP)</h3>
<p>An identity provider, known as an IdP, has user accounts and does authentication. In federated identify environments, they develop a security token with claims regarding the user, such as the date of birth. Afterward, the security token gets a digital signature from the IdP and its private key. IdP signatures with its public key are essential for the application to trust the IdP. Finally, the apps will receive the tokens and authorize user access. </p>
