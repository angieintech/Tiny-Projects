<p>People can install git on their computers by first installing homebrew. Afterwards, they can go on the terminal and type this brew command:
  $ brew install git</p>
<p>On the terminal, make a new directory using the mkdir command with a name. For example, we can make a directory with "mkdir project" . Next, create a file such as an HTML file that you want to update on your GitHub site.  If there is a mistake in the file, no worries. - We can update it by doing a pull request.  </p>
