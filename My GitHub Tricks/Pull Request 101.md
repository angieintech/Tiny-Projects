<h1>How to make a pull request?</h1>

<h2>There are a series to steps that GitHub users can use to make a pull request. A common way of making a pull request is by using git commands from the terminal. In this tip document, I will mention how to do pull requests on a Mac terminal.</h2>
 
    <h3>Install git</h3>
<p>People can install git on their computers by first installing homebrew. Afterwards, they can go on the terminal and type this brew command:
  $ brew install git</p>
    
    <h3>Create a directory</h3>
<p>On the terminal, make a new directory using the mkdir command with a name. For example, we can make a directory with "mkdir project" . Next, create a file such as an HTML file that you want to update on your GitHub site.  If there is a mistake in the file, no worries. - We can update it by doing a pull request. However, before we do a pull request we need to create a branch aside from our main branch. </p>
